Consider the following classes:
    public class Cell { ... }
    public class BloodCell extends Cell { ... }
    public class RedBloodCell extends BloodCell { ... }

For each of the following assignments, say if it is valid or invalid. In a clear and concise sentence, explain why the illegal ones are invalid.
    ✦ Cell c = new BloodCell();
    - valid
    - class BloodCell() is a subclass class class Cell()

    ✦ Cell c = new RedBloodCell();
    - valid
    - class RedBloodCell() is a subclass class Cell()

    ✦ BloodCell c = new RedBloodCell();
    - valid
    - class RedBloodCell() is a subcless of class BloodCell()

    ✦ RedBloodCell c = new BloodCell();
    - invalid
    - class BloodCell() is not a subclass of class RedBloodCell(); e.g. a BloodCell() is not a type of RedBloodCell(); is not a valid heirarchy.
